io.svc.security
===============

Scala security library. Or: **the quest for the real meaning of security**.

Here are some points to get you started:

* [Presentation of the pattern that is used in this library](http://blog.rintcius.nl/post/di-on-steroids-with-scala-value-injection-on-traits.html)
* [`authentication`](https://github.com/svc-io/io.svc.security/blob/master/src/main/scala/io/svc/security/authentication.scala) object
* [Play binding](https://github.com/svc-io/io.svc.security.play) plus a [play demo app](https://github.com/svc-io/io.svc.security.play.demo)

I guess some more info will need to be added here, but I'll leave that for later.

TODO
----
Lots ;)

Here are just a couple of ideas:

* bindings with other web frameworks and libraries, analogous to [the play binding](https://github.com/svc-io/io.svc.security.play)
* integration with [jBCrypt](http://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/) and friends for encrypted password storage
* add support for authorization
* support more forms of authentication


Start hacking on io.svc.security
--------------------------------
Please [fork away](https://github.com/svc-io/io.svc.security/fork_select) & start hacking!

Also note that [github issues](https://github.com/svc-io/io.svc.security/issues) are not (just) for issues. 
A more positive name for it would be "hey, what do you & the rest of the universe think of this?" 
or more url-friendly: "hey".
Anyway, I have created a 'discussion' label for the hey-sayers.
